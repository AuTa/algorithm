# [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```
**Note:**
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
